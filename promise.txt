Promise Object Properties
A JavaScript Promise object can be:

Pending
Fulfilled
Rejected
The Promise object supports two properties: state and result.

While a Promise object is "pending" (working), the result is undefined.

When a Promise object is "fulfilled", the result is a value.

When a Promise object is "rejected", the result is an error object.

myPromise.state	myPromise.result
"pending"	undefined
"fulfilled"	a result value
"rejected"	an error object
You cannot access the Promise properties state and result.

You must use a Promise method to handle promises.
Promise.then() takes two arguments, a callback for success and another for failure.

Both are optional, so you can add a callback for success or failure only.
